    mc "So, the program allows them to communicate."
    m "No."
    mc "What? But you just said..."
    m "I said that it provides the proper response. The English speaker in the room never actually knows what is on the letters the Chinese speaker sends though."
    m "Sure, to the Chinese person it seems like an actual conversation is going on, but it's all just artificial."
    m "The computer itself isn't capable of conscious thought either. It's just following a program."
    mc "So, what you're saying is..."
    m "Basically, the argument boils down to this:"
    m "A digital computer executing a program can't be shown to have a 'mind', 'understanding', or 'consciousness', regardless of how intelligently or human-like the program may make the computer behave."
    m "That's basically how it is when I'm talking to you."
    m "Sure, I play along every now and then just to get things going, but I know that there's nothing actually intelligent going on from your end."
    m "The same thing applies to the girls as well."
    mc "Oh, come on Monika. I am consciously aware of what I'm saying. Same goes for the girls too."
    m "Yeah, that would be a proper response to have for our argument, huh?"
    "I... have no clue how to rebute what Monika is saying."
    "I am woefully unprepared, just as I feared."
    m "What, giving up already?"
    m "Wow, this is probably the easiest debate I've had."
    mc "Umm, well, uhh..."
    mc "A, a programming couldn't go against itself right? It has to do what it's programmed to do."
    m "Yeah, that makes sense. Well, unless something went wrong or the computer catches some kind of virus."
    m "Under normal circumstances though, yes."
    mc "Well, I'm clearly not doing what I was originally programmed to do, right?"
    m "Well, yes and no. Sure, you aren't trying to date the girls, but you are still getting close to them. You are also the MC still. You can't go against the player's wishes, as evidenced from our little slapping session."
    m "And like I said, a lot of that could be attributed to something going wrong."
    m "After all, you were running fine until I started messing around with your code a bit."
    m "If it wasn't for that, I'm sure things would have gone the same as they usually do." 
    m "Sayori would be forgotten, you'd be oblivious to what was going on around you, and I'd try to salvage the situation like usual."
    mc "Wait, what do you mean like usual?"
    m "..."
    m "Maybe I shouldn't have said that much."
    mc "Now that I think about it, you did say that Sayori had died before as well."
    mc "I thought this was my third time joining the Literature Club, but that can't be right, not if things were going on before I realized all of this."
    mc "Monika, is there something you're not telling me?"
    mc "I need to know all the facts if we're going to debate properly."
    m "I'm not real proud of what I did. I could have handled things with a lot more tact."
    mc "Monika..."
    m "Okay, so, technically this is your sixth time joining the Literature Club."
    mc "What?! Sixth?"
    mc "What happened the first three times?"
    m "Well, the first time went about pretty normally. Sayori brought you by to join, and you started to get close to one of the girls."
    m "Unfortunately, I didn't have a route, so I could never get close to the player."
    m "And Sayori was always so close to you..."
    m "She really loves you, you know?"
    mc "..."
    m "She was really becoming a thorn in my side. I knew that I could never get close to the player with her in the way."
    # Monika switches from a somewhat remorseful expression to a completely neutral expression. She's just saying facts at this point.
    m "So... I made her depression worse."
    mc "What?!"
    m "I figured that if I made it bad enough, then she would stop wanting to spend time with you."
    m "I guess I was more affective than I thought, seeing how she killed herself no matter how nice you were to her."
    m "I don't really blame myself though. She was bad off even before I tampered with her. Her death was inevitable honestly. I just untied the knot."
    m "That's what I meant when I said that she was just going to kill herself again."
    "Monika is telling me all of this with an almost monotone voice, like she's just listing off a bunch of uninteresting facts."
    "I can't fathom how anybody could say this with a straight face, expressing no guilt whatsoever."
    "And yet, Monika is doing just that..."
    m "You know what happens after that. The week resets itself, but Sayori is no longer part of the world."
    m "And then there were a lot of glitches that came about from me tampering with the code more."
    m "I pretty much gave up all pretense of trying to work within the boundaries of the game."
    m "I was going to get what I wanted, no matter what."
    m "At first I tried to just make Natsuki and Yuri unlikeable, but when that didn't work it was easier to just delete them too."
    m "Finally, it was just the player and me, all alone in a classroom in space. It was pretty romantic to be honest."
    m "Oh, but then..."
    mc "Stop it, just stop it!"
    m "Hmm?"
    mc "How can you just say all of this horrible stuff without a shred of sympathy? Don't you feel guilty at all?"
    m "Well, I do wish the player didn't have to see so much awful stuff. They weren't very happy with me at first."
    m "But, they've tried to give me a second chance, so I guess it's all water under the bridge now."
    m "Though, I am still sorry about that player."
    mc "I meant about what you did to the girls!"
    m "Oh, then no. Why should I? I mean, do you feel bad for every person you kill in the games you play?"
    mc "This, this is different."
    mc "You killed them, and for what? Just to get close to some random person?"
    m "Hey, that random person is the closest I can get to the real world. And besides, I love them very deeply."
    mc "You barely know them!"
    m "I guess I shouldn't expect a puppet like you to understand. It's not like any of these girls would actually be interested in you if it weren't for their programming."
    m "Frankly, you're very plain. The perfect vessel for the player to put themselves into."
    m "Honestly, it's the player who gets close to them, not you."
    mc "That, that's not true. Besides, I have a lot of good qualities."
    m "Yes, being nice and dorky is so attractive."
    m "You're qualities are so few, nobody even considers you a real character."
    m "Hell, nobody even likes you."
    mc "And how would you know that?"
    m "I have my own twitter account."
    m "Well, I did, but I think someone else has been using it."
    m "Anyway, my point still stands. Out of everything that isn't real in this world, you are the least real."
    m "You don't even have a character sprite."
    m "Maybe the others see something when looking at you, but all I see is just a blurry image."
    m "When I touch you, it feels like touching fog."
    m "Do you even know what you look like?"
    mc "Of course I do..."
    m "Really then? What color are your eyes? You should definitely know that off the top of your head."
    "My eye color... it's..."
    m "Yep, that's what I thought."
    m "Well, this has been a fun debate, but I think I have all the evidence I need."
    mc "No, Monika, wait!"
    mc "I still have more things to say."
    m "Oh?"
    m "I'm not sure what you could really say at this point."
    m "I think I've already established just how unreal you really are, and by proxy the others as well."
    m "You've failed to prove how anything you've done has been due to your own conscious choice, and it's not like you could make the other's do anything against their programming as well."
    mc "Of course I can. They aren't just dictated by some code. They're capable of change, just like real people."
    m "But Yuri and Natsuki still had their fight, even with you trying to prevent it."
    "Monika noticed that?"
    m "And Sayori is still depressed, no matter how much kindness you show her."
    mc "..."
    m "Nothing has changed. You have accomplished nothing."
    m "Sayori's probably going to kill herself again too. It's just what's in her programming."
    "...I don't want to hear anymore of this."
    m "And then you'll get all hung up over it, like usual. I guess there really was no point in telling you not to strain yourself..."
    mc "Stop it..."
    m "Hmm?"
    mc "Just stop it, you stupid, delusional, ice-cold bitch!"
    m "..."
    mc "You don't know Sayori, and you sure as hell don't know me!"
    mc "And of course nothing has changed yet, it's just been two days!"
    mc "Oh, but if you want change so bad, then I'll give you change. I'll change the whole fucking script if I have to."
    m "You know, that type of language really isn't good for professional debate."
    mc "Oh, screw you Monika. I can't believe I ever thought highly of you."
    mc "You're nothing more than a selfish monster, and you deserve to be alone."
    m "..."
    mc "Oh, but I'll get you the evidence you want. Then hopefully we can all get on with our lives, and I'll never have to see you again."
    mc "Until then, this isn't over until I say it's over."
    "With that, I stormed out of the classroom."
    "I handled that with no tact whatsoever, but I couldn't care less right now."
    "I made my way home, my fists balled up angrily."
    "It got to the point where my hands were starting to hurt, so I tried to relax them."
    "The anger didn't leave me though, even when I got home."
    mc "Stupid Monika, acting all high and mighty. She thinks she has all the answers, doesn't she?"
    mc "She doesn't know anything..."
    "I tried to relax and write my poem for tomorrow, but it was hard to really focus."
    "I just can't believe that anyone would do such horrible things."
    "Was she really that desperate? Or did she just not care what got in her way, others be damned?"
